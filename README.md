# Korean-text-translator
NLP based project which coverts an image of Korean words to text format and can translate it to English.
- I used pytesseract and pyttsx3 libraries to extract text from an image.
- In this case I'm extracting Korean text
- I then use the translator API and translate the Korean text to English
